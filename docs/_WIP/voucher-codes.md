A discount voucher code (aka coupon or promotional code) is a string of numbers you can enter when you are about to purchase a product or at any time in your account overview.

A voucher code has a value in EUR and a date of expiry when to enter the code. You can only use one voucher code at a time. The voucher code will be applied as a negative position in your next invoice. If the voucher code value is bigger than the total sum of the invoice it will be used for the next invoice(s).


### How to get a voucher code

That's the tricky part. We might run promotions here and there. A good way to keep track of this is to follow us on twitter.

### Enter a voucher code

You got your code? Congrats! Login to the dashboard (create an Account if don't already have one). Go to your account overview and scroll down. There is an input where you can enter your voucher code.


### No voucher without valid payment method

Sorry, unfortunately there is no way to enter a voucher without a valid payment method. Imagine you have used a voucher code to book a large setup, what should happen, when the voucher code is used up? Freeze, you might think? No, we currently only can freeze small Apps. We simply have no way (yet) to deal with a scenario when a voucher is depleted and you don't have a valid payment. That's why it takes a valid payment method to enter a voucher code.

### Sell by date

Sorry, Voucher codes come invalid after some time. They should be handed to you with best use before instructions.
