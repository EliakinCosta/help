We have three generations of Apps/Stacks here on fortrabbit: 

* **Old Apps Stack** (2013 - 2017) this here
* [Professional Stack](app-pro) (from 2015 on) < formerly known as New App
* [Universal Stack](app-uni) (from 2016 on)



## Migrating

Unfortunatly, we can not switch the App for you. Apps have to be migrated manually. You can choose how you would like to migrate your Old App:

1. **[Migrate Old App to Universal Stack](/migrate-old-to-uni)** < most commonly used
2. [Migrate Old App to Professional Stack](/migrate-old-to-pro)
