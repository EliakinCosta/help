No need to explain this anymore: [Composer](http://getcomposer.org) is the defacto standard to handle PHP application dependencies, as well as providing mechanisms to keep them up2date.

## Usage

**TL;DR**: Just `git push`. On fortrabbit you [(of course) exclude](https://getcomposer.org/doc/faqs/should-i-commit-the-dependencies-in-my-vendor-directory.md) the `vendor` folder from Git. This directory is created by Composer within in your project locally and contains all the packages you are using. This way only your own code — not any dependency — is included into Git.

During deployment to fortrabbit Composer will be executed automatically, assuming that both the `composer.lock` file and the `composer.json` file are present.

The deployment build process executes `composer install` and never the update variant to make sure that exactly the packages your App requires are installed.

### Composer in the deployment file

You can fine tune your deployment behavior and aspects of Composer in the deployment file. See the options withunder the `composer:` keyword [here](deployment-file-v2).

### Use Private repositories in Composer

You need to add the private repositories into your `composer.json` file? Read on [here](private-composer-repos).

### Composer from SSH

Universal Apps only: You can execute Composer from [SSH](ssh-uni). Composer is pre-installed (latest stable) per default and all you need to do is execute it:

```bash
$ ssh {{ssh-user}}@deploy.{{region}}.frbit.com
$ composer install
```

### Use alternative location

If your `composer.json` and `composer.lock` file are not on top level, then they will be ignored by the deployment. However, you can use the `pre` directive from the [deployment file](deployment-file) to setup a custom composer run in a different directory.

Following an example which assumes that your `composer.*` files are within the folder `sub-folder`:

**fortrabbit.yml**

```yaml
version: 2

# execute alternate composer run before anything
pre: composer-run.php

# makre sure the new vendor folder is sustained during deploys
sustained:
  - sub-folder/vendor
```

**composer-run.php**

```php
<?php

chdir("sub-folder");
exec("composer install");
```
