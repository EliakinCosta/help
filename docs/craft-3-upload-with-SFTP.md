## Prerequisite

Make sure you to have this done before starting here:

1. Complete all steps in the [get ready guide](/get-ready).
2. Download and unpack the latest Craft zip file from here: [craftcms.com/latest-v3.zip](https://craftcms.com/latest-v3.zip)
3. Have [Craft installed and running locally](/craft-3-install-locally).

_PSSST_: We also have advanced ways to [deploy Craft with Git](/craft-3-deploy-with-git-uni).

## 

SFTP also works here. Just download Craft directly from the Craft website: [craftcms.com/latest-v3.zip](https://craftcms.com/latest-v3.zip). Unpack that zip file to get to the actual project files.

Use SFTP to upload your Craft website, when you started by downloading the archive file.

This workflow is so simple and common that it doesn't actually needs much explanations. Just grab your personal SFTP login credentials from the Dashboard. Use any SFTP client. Upload all contents of your local Craft folder into the `htdocs` folder of your fortrabbit App.
