## Download and install Craft CMS locally

Use the detailed [official Craft 3 install guide](https://github.com/craftcms/docs/blob/v3/en/installation.md) as your guideline to install Craft on your local machine first. The way you do that will set the course on how you will [deploy](/deployment-methods) Craft CMS here on fortrabbit. **Choose your workflow now**:

### Download Craft CMS

#### 1a. Download Craft with Composer + deploy with Git

This is the recommended - more sophisticated - way. You will use [Git](/git) and [Composer](/comoser#toc-local-composer) in the Terminal. Run this command **on you local machine** to create a Craft 3 project:

```
$ composer create-project craftcms/craft {{app-name}}
```

See an error? Check your [local development](/local-development).

#### 1b. Download the Craft zip file + upload with SFTP

Are you more "designer" and less "developer"? SFTP also works here. Just download Craft directly from the Craft website: [craftcms.com/latest-v3.zip](https://craftcms.com/latest-v3.zip). Unpack that zip file to get to the actual project files.


### Install Craft CMS locally

Craft 3 uses environment variables to access environment specific settings. With your fortrabbit Craft App, those variables are already set. Configure it to work on your local machine now. You have two options to install Craft:

#### 2a. Terminal setup

```
# 1. go into your local Craft folder 
$ cd {{app-name}}

# 2. run the terminal installer
$ ./craft setup
```

This will ask you some questions, the defaults will work mostly, you can change these settings [later](#toc-mastering-the-env-file).

#### 2b. Browser setup

You can also run the installer in the browser by visiting this address: `http://{{host}}/index.php?p=admin` in your browser. Substitute `{{host}}` with the [host name of your local development environment](/local-development#toc-virtual-hosts). 

- - -

**Wrap up**: By now your Craft CMS should already run locally. You should be able to visit your Craft installation on your local machine and login to the Craft admin panel.


## Deploy Craft CMS

Now it's time to show your great Craft website to the world for the first time. Get your local Craft CMS up to fortrabbit. Start here if you already have an existing Craft installation. So depending on how you downloaded and installed Craft CMS, you'll now continue with either A. or B.:

### 3a. Deploy with Git

Use Git deployment when you have already used Composer to create your Craft installation. Trigger the following commands in your **local** terminal:


```
# 1. Initialize Git (when not already done)
$ git init .

# 2. Add your App's Git remote to your local repo
$ git remote add fortrabbit {{ssh-user}}@deploy.{{region}}.frbit.com:{{app-name}}.git

# 3. Download our Craft .gitignore file
$ curl -O  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fortrabbit/craft-starter/master/.gitignore

# 4. Add changes to Git
$ git add -A

# 5. Commit changes
$ git commit -m 'My first commit'

# 6. Initial push and upstream
$ git push -u fortrabbit master
# The first push takes a little longer
# as it runs Composer

# 7. From there on only
$ git push
```

**Got an error?** Please see the [access troubleshooting](/access-methods#toc-troubleshooting). **Did it work?** Cool, finally you can visit your fortrabbit Craft App in your browser:

* [{{app-name}}.frb.io](https://{{app-name}}.frb.io)


#### Uploading assets in a Git workflow

Assets in Craft are the files that are managed by Craft, also see [the official Craft docs](https://docs.craftcms.com/v3/assets.html). This user generated stuff, uploaded files, mostly images. The [fortrabbit Craft CMS starter .gitignore](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fortrabbit/craft-starter/master/.gitignore) file excludes `/web/assets/*` from Git. Why? Because, code and content are separated and the assets uploaded to the App are [not represented in Git](https://help.fortrabbit.com/deployment-methods-uni#toc-git-works-only-one-way) anyways.

So when you deploy using Git here, the assets must be managed and deployed independently. [SFTP](/sftp-uni#toc-accessing-sftp) is one way to to do it. We recommend giving `rsync` on the command line a try. It's easier than you think: 

```
# Sync local assets with remote
$ rsync -av ./web/assets/ {{app-name}}@deploy.{{region}}.frbit.com:~/web/assets/
```

Our [rsync tutorial](https://blog.fortrabbit.com/deploying-code-with-rsync) covers many useful rsync options, like excludes, `--dry-run` and `--delete`.


### 3b. Upload Craft CMS via SFTP

Use SFTP to upload your Craft website, when you started by downloading the archive file.

This workflow is so simple and common that it doesn't actually needs much explanations. Just grab your personal SFTP login credentials from the Dashboard. Use any SFTP client. Upload all contents of your local Craft folder into the `htdocs` folder of your fortrabbit App.

That's it, basically. Thanks for following so far!

## Tuning

Continue reading to dig even deeper. Learn how to tweak Craft CMS and tackle problems.

### Database export and import

Database migrations are first-class citizen in Craft 3. Using this pattern keeps changes consistent across all environments. However, this does not help with the actual data which is stored locally already. To get started, you'll need to export a mysqldump first and then import that into your Apps database. Here is how to this in the Terminal:

```bash
# On your local machine
$ mysqldump -ulocal-db-user -plocal-db-password local-db-name > dump.sql
```

Now you need to open a tunnel and import the just created dump file into your remote database. This requires two terminal windows: One containing the open tunnel, the other to execute the import.

```bash
# Open the tunnel
$ ssh -N -L 13306:{{app-name}}.mysql.{{region}}.frbit.com:3306 {{ssh-user}}@deploy.{{region}}.frbit.com

# !!! in a new terminal window !!!
# Import the dump
$ mysql -h127.0.0.1 -P13306 -u{{app-name}} -p {{app-name}} < dump.sql
```

You can also do this with a MySQL GUI of course, please see our [MySQL guides](/mysql) for more on the topic.

### Table prefixes

You can set a MySQL table prefix in the `.env` file locally or in the ENV vars settings with your App in the Dashboard like so:

```
# Align the prefix with the one you are using locally
DB_TABLE_PREFIX=craft_
```

### Updating Craft

From time to time a new minor Craft version will come out, like an update from 3.0.5 to 3.0.6. We recommend to always use the latest version for security reasons. Depending on your deployment workflow (see above), there are two ways to update Craft:


#### A. Update Craft with a Git workflow

Don't click the shiny update button in the interface. Don't follow [the official guides](https://docs.craftcms.com/v3/updating.html) here. User Composer instead! First update your local installation, then push the changes to trigger the update on remote. Run the following command in the terminal on your computer **locally**: 

```shell
# Make sure to be in the projects root folder (locally)
$ composer update

# The output looks something like this: 
Loading composer repositories with package information
Installing dependencies (including require-dev) from lock file
Package operations: 0 installs, 17 updates, 1 removal
  - Updating craftcms/cms (3.0.0-RC7 => 3.0.0-RC12): Downloading (100%)
  - Updating yiisoft/yii2 (2.0.13.1 => 2.0.14): Downloading (100%)
 [...]
  - Updating ostark/craft-async-queue (1.1.5 => 1.3.0):  Checking out c262aa5e21
  - Updating symfony/var-dumper (v3.4.3 => v3.4.4): Downloading (100%)
```

The `composer.lock` file reflects the exact package versions you've installed locally. Commit your updated lock file and push it to your App. During the [Git deployment](/git-deployment), `composer install` will run automatically. This way your local composer changes get applied on the remote.

Some plugins or the Craft core may include database migrations. Don't forget to run the following SSH remote execution command after the updated packages are deployed:

```bash
$ ssh {{app-name}}@deploy.{{region}}.frbit.com "php craft setup/update"
```

#### B. Update Craft with a SFTP workflow

Just use the shiny update button interface. Follow [the official guides](https://docs.craftcms.com/v3/updating.html). You need to do that twice: Once for your local installation, once for the one on remote (ony your App).


### Mastering the .env file

In your local environment the Craft settings are stored in the `.env` file. This hidden file is excluded from Git as it stores sensitive information only suited for a single environment. Edit the `.env` file with text editor. Don't upload it to fortrabbit. These settings include:

#### Security key

We recommend to use the security key of your fortrabbit App. Go to the App's ENV vars settings in the Dashboard and copy the content of the `security_key` variable - it's the last line in the textarea. Here is the direct link:

* [dashboard.fortrabbit.com/apps/{{app-name}}/vars](https://dashboard.fortrabbit.com/apps/{{app-name}}/vars)

Paste that long string into the value of the `SECURITY_KEY` within your local `.env` file. Here is what the specific line looks like:

```
SECURITY_KEY={{PASTE-KEY-FROM-DASHBOARD-HERE}}
```

When you have installed Craft with Composer that value might already contain a value. Just replace it with the one from the fortrabbit Dashboard.


#### MySQL

Your Craft CMS needs to connect to two databases: 1. To the database on your local machine, 2. to the fortrabbit database. This is what the according lines in your local `.env` file can look like:

```
# Use your own local settings as values of course
DB_DATABASE=database-name
DB_SERVER=127.0.0.1
DB_USER=mysql-user
DB_PASSWORD=mysql-password
```

The actual values for accessing your local database are depending on your [local development environment](/local-development). For your Craft fortrabbit App everything is already set and done.


#### Environment settings

We expect fortrabbit to be your production environment, so it has been set accordingly in the ENV vars. Your local development environment will be "dev". This is what your `.env` file needs to contain:

```
ENVIRONMENT=dev
```

It's maybe there already. **Pro tip**: See below on how to [enable Dev Mode](#toc-dev-mode).








### Dev Mode

Sometime while developing you might want to see some error output directly on your browser screen. That's what Dev Mode is for. See the official Craft CMS docs for more details:

* [craftcms.com/support/dev-mode](https://craftcms.com/support/dev-mode)

Here is an example of a configuration group `config/general.php`:

```
<?php
return [
    // Global settings
    '*' => [
        'cpTrigger' => 'brewery',
    ],
    // ENVIRONMENT specific 
    'production' => [
        'devMode' => false,
    ],
    'dev' => [
        'devMode' => true,
    ],
];
```

The `ENVIRONMENT` which is defined in the ENV vars, maps with the array key `production` (usually fortrabbit), or `dev` (usually locally).


### Older versions of Craft

We have an install guide for Craft Version 2 [over here](/install-craft-2-uni) as well, but recommend to use Craft 3 instead. Consider an upgrade when you have an old installation. 


### Upgrading from Craft 2

You already have Craft 2 CMS installed and you are now looking to upgrade it to version 3? Here is what you need to know. First of all, please read the official upgrade guide:

* [docs.craftcms.com/v3/upgrade.html](https://docs.craftcms.com/v3/upgrade.html)

Craft 2 was way more simple. So we have recommended to use SFTP deployment. With Craft 3 many things are different, modern and more powerful. Just the way we like it:

* configuration with `dotenv` files
* new directory structure
* Composer based workflow
* Git support

Now you have two options to upgrade from Craft 2 to Craft 3:

#### 1. Quick update

The above linked guide offer you a way to upgrade with as little intervention as possible. Go that route if you are looking a quick way to upgrade. Keep your current directory structure and continue the SFTP workflow. 

#### 2. Full update

So you want to make use Git and Composer and resemble the new Craft 3 directory structure? Then you best: Start a new Craft 3 project from scratch, import your templates, configs and contents.

For more details on this workflow, see the [offcial guide](https://docs.craftcms.com/v3/upgrade.html#if-you-want-your-directory-structure-to-resemble-a-new-craft-3-project).
