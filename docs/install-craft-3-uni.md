## Intro

We are super excited about Craft 3! However, if you plan to launch new Craft sites within the next weeks you should go with the current stable version. [Here is the install guide for Craft 2](/install-craft-2-uni). If you are curious about the future this is the place to be.


## Get ready

We assume you've already created an App and chose Craft CMS in the stack chooser. If not: You can do so in the [fortrabbit Dashboard](/dashboard).

### Root path

Go to the Dashboard and [set the root path](/app#toc-root-path) of your App's domains to **web**, the default in Craft 2 was **public**.

<div markdown="1" data-user="known">
[Change the root path for App URL of App: **{{app-name}}**](https://dashboard.fortrabbit.com/apps/{{app-name}}/rootpath)
</div>


## Quick start

Follow the [offical Craft 3 install guide](https://github.com/craftcms/docs/blob/master/en/installation.md) and use `composer create-project` to run Craft locally first. 
Leave the `config/db.php` untouched, but add this ENV vars to your App. It's a mapping from our default ENV vars to the names Craft expects. 

```osterei32
# Crypto key
SECURITY_KEY=ClickToGenerate

# The environment Craft is currently running in dev, staging, production, etc.
ENVIRONMENT=dev

# DB Mapping (don't use actual values)
DB_DATABASE=${MYSQL_DATABASE}
DB_SERVER=${MYSQL_HOST}
DB_USER=${MYSQL_USER}
DB_PASSWORD=${MYSQL_PASSWORD}

# DB Driver
DB_DRIVER=mysql
```

<div markdown="1" data-user="known">
[Add ENV vars to your App: **{{app-name}}**](https://dashboard.fortrabbit.com/apps/{{app-name}}/vars)
</div>

## Git Deployment

Before pushing the first time to fortrabbit, make sure to `git add composer.lock -f`.


## Updating Craft

The lastest beta is just a `composer update` away. When you run this command in the terminal locally, the output looks something like this: 

```plain
Loading composer repositories with package information
Updating dependencies (including require-dev)

 [...]
 
  - Removing yiisoft/yii2-debug (2.0.7)
  - Installing yiisoft/yii2-debug (2.0.11)
    Downloading: 100%

  - Removing craftcms/cms (3.0.0-beta.26)
  - Installing craftcms/cms (3.0.0-beta.29)
    Downloading: 100%
```

The `composer.lock` file reflects the exact package versions you've installed locally. Commit your updated lock file and push it to your App's `master` branch. The packages got installed during the deployment. As you can see it takes just a few seconds:

That's it. 


## Using the craft cli
